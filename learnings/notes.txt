Flask is a web server framework uses python
other python web servers framework are -
    Django
    web2py
    bottle
    cherrypy
A devops engineer everyday deal with some web server

RestAPI - best way to deal with API
    API - application programing interface
    client - server model (request and responce)
    request - protocol//hostname:port/route
    visit and check - reqres.in
    GET - no data going from client
    POST - with some data
    POSTMAN

JSON -
    key value

we learn mini flask program - app.py
    - routes
    - run with debug = true
    - fetching data from request url and JSON (in route code)

serving template
    - render template in flask

serving dynamic template
    - render some html page but it needs to be dynamic
    - for this in html page use double {{ put_dynamic_thing_here }}
    - this is jinja code

Data from frontend to backend
    - in frontend page create a form and put action on submit
    - method will be POST
    - in backend fetch via request.form.get()

Database
    - 4 types
        - relational / sequal db   (have bunch of table) [mysql,postgress]
        - document / nosql db   (it has documents / JSON file) (database - collection - document)
        [mongodb,couchdb]
        - graph db (database>nodes>edges) [Neo4j]
        - kay-value db (database>key>value) [Redis,Risk]

    - another way to store
        - blob stores (database>blobs) [aws s3, google cloud storage]
            it is nested structure of files and folders

Integrate mongodb
(notes in copy)

Microservices - concept of software architecture design
    - application in parts which are not dependently working
    - app will be combination of micro services

how it work in simple application -
- in frontend microservice just have frontend codes
- in backend microservice just write the code to connect with database
- when frontend and backend was together form was giving POST request and browser was able to show
    but when we write fe and be separately then fe will need GET request
- app.run(host,port,debug=True)
- BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:9000'
- import requests
